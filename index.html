                <h3>Meditation</h3>
                <p>The spine is designed for both mobility and stability, and often, we can have too much of one and not enough of the other. For optimal daily functioning, to live a fully functional life, we need a certain degree of mobility: enough to look behind us while backing up a car, to look both ways before crossing a street, to get down to and up from the floor, or out of a bathtub, to tie our shoes or to play our chosen sports. We also need enough stability to lift and carry objects or and children without risk of injury.</p>

        <h4>Why Yoga for Engineering Students?</h4>
        <p>Yoga has become a creative part of the student’s educational programme; they are experiencing the meaning of discipline in a very spontaneous way in the first year of their engineering life. Yoga education supplements school and university education.

            Apart from Yoga’s normal benefits, namely better breathing, gentle stretching, concentration & awareness, relaxation, calmness and appreciation of silence, Yoga balances both hemispheres of the brain and develops the whole mind.
